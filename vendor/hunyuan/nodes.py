"""HunyuanImage-3.0 nodes: a MODEL socket, its conditioning, and a latent at any size.

The graph is stock from here on. This file hands out a genuine `MODEL` (a `ModelPatcher` wrapping a
`comfy.model_base.BaseModel`), `CONDITIONING`, and a `LATENT`, so `KSampler`, `SamplerCustom`, and
`VAEDecode` drive it the way they drive every other model. Nothing here samples.

**The sampling settings are part of this model's contract, not preferences.** The schedule ComfyUI
reproduces bit-for-bit is `ModelSamplingDiscreteFlow(shift=3.0)` under the `simple` scheduler — the
frontend's usual `normal` default drifts by 2.9e-1, which is silent quality loss. The rest follows from
which checkpoint the weights are, which the loader reads off the weights. Instruct-Distil is 8-step
distilled with meanflow: sample it at 8 steps with `cfg` 1.0, where ComfyUI skips the unconditional
pass, and expect other step counts, other schedulers and `denoise < 1.0` to drift from its trajectory.
Instruct and the base run an ordinary schedule — the step count and guidance there are yours to choose.
The workflows in `workflows/` preselect each checkpoint's settings.
