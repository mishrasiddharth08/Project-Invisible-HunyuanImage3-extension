"""Ops for a non-quantized checkpoint: the plain weight-dtype operations plus the routed-expert bank
the model needs.

`comfy.ops.mixed_precision_ops` supplies `MoEExperts` only when the checkpoint carries a `quant_config`,
so a bf16 checkpoint builds no bank and the MoE block raises `AttributeError: type object
'disable_weight_init' has no attribute 'MoEExperts'` at construction. The bank is a layout detail
rather than a quantization one — one `[num_experts, out, in]` tensor either way — so it is added here to
the plain operations, and the model, the load path and the offload gate stay identical between the two.
