"""Load a HunyuanImage-3.0 checkpoint into a native `HunyuanImage3Model`.

The loader returns a `ModelPatcher` wrapping a `comfy.model_base.BaseModel`, which is what a MODEL
socket carries, so the stock sampler drives this model the same way it drives any other. Phase 1 builds
that model from here rather than through `comfy.sd` and a `supported_models` signature: `MODEL` is
nominal, so a node can hand out a genuine one without a registry entry.

The checkpoint converted for ComfyUI carries no config. Tencent's `config.json` and `tokenizer.json` ship with
this package (`tencent/`): one of each serves all three checkpoints (see `tencent/README.md`).

# under the other's template is silent — the sequence is well-formed either way and only the model
